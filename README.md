+ `vue-tippy` a vue tooltip handler based on `tippy.js`.
+ `vue-izitoast` a good Toaster or SnackBar for `vue` (we used `vue-izitoast2` for typescript support)
+ `vue-slick-carousel` a carousel or slider that is rendered in server-side (SSR). (we used `vue-slick-carousel` for handling localization correctly)
  + `draggable-nuxt-link` an internal plugin for preparing a good UX `nuxt-link` while sliding carousel. (available in the `plugins/draggable-nuxt-link` folder, you can use it by `<DNuxtLink>` tag in your project)
+ `vue-select` a vue dropdown

### Networking
+ `axios` a substitution of `fetch` to handling network requests.
+ GraphQL support:
  + `@nuxt/apollo` communicating with GraphQL (integrated with `axios-fetch`).
  + `@vue/apollo-composable` use `@nuxt/apollo` in Composition-API context.
  
### Form validation
+ `vee-validate` form validation (with i18n activated)

### Development Tools
+ `eslint` linting and syntax control (with typescript support)
+ `@nuxt/typescript-build` using typescript in the project by `lang="ts"` direction.
  (**Note**: At the moment `"@nuxt/typescript-build@^2.1.0` is consistent with `typescript@~4.2`, so this package contains the ~4.2 version)
  
### Vuex
+ `vuex` is activated by an empty `index.js` file in the `store/` directory. (It's important for some features like `redirecting`)
+ Also `vuex-persist` is activated with **cookie storage**:
  + for working with the **vuex states** in the *server*,
  + and persisting the data after reloading the page in the *client*. 
  + The config file is `~/plugins/vuex-persist.js`.
  + If you want to restrict the persistence to only some specific vuex modules,
  you have to uncomment the `modules:` property in the configuration file and add your module name that you used before in the `store` directory.

### API Endpoints
For development and deployment, two local addresses `http://localhost:8000/api` and `http://localhost:8000/graphql` are configured as the default endpoints.

To change these values you can use `.env` file.
